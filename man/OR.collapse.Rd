\title{Collapse repeated measurements across IDs}
\usage{
OR.collapse(data, ID_varname, pattern, method = "single")
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame containing repeated measurements.}

\item{ID_varname}{Character string giving the name of the ID variable. Rows
with the same ID are treated as belonging to the same individual.}

\item{pattern}{String containing a regular expression used to select
variables. All variable names matching this pattern (via \code{grep()}) are
collapsed.}

\item{method}{Character string specifying how multiple values within each ID
should be collapsed. Options include:
\itemize{
\item \code{"left"}: Returns the first non-missing value in order of appearance.
\item \code{"mean"}: Returns the mean of non-missing values.
\item \code{"max"}: Returns the maximum of non-missing values.
\item \code{"min"}: Returns the minimum of non-missing values.
\item \code{"single"} (default): Returns the mean of non-missing values and prints
a message if more than one unique non-missing value is found.
\item \code{"sum"}: Returns the sum of non-missing values.
}}
}
\value{
A data frame with one row per unique ID and one column for each
variable matching \code{pattern}, summarized according to \code{method}.
}
\description{
For each ID in a data frame, collapses all rows belonging to that ID into a
single row. Variables whose names match a specified pattern are summarized
according to a chosen \code{method}. The output data frame contains one row per
unique ID and one column per matched variable. Non-matching variables are
ignored.
}
\details{
An example use case is when working with REDCap exports, where the
measurements for one patient are distributed across multiple event rows.
