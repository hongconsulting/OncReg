\usage{

}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Numeric vector of observations.}

\item{p}{Target two-sided exclusion proportion under normality. That is, the
proportion of observations expected to lie beyond the cutoff in a sample of
size \code{n} from a normal distribution. Default = \code{0.05}.}
}
\value{
Logical vector of the same length as \code{x} where \code{TRUE} indicates an
outlier.
}
\description{
Flags observations whose absolute deviation from the sample median
exceeds a sample-size–adjusted multiple of the median absolute deviation.
