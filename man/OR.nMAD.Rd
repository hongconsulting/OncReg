\title{Small-sample MAD cutoff under normality}
\usage{
OR.nMAD(n, p = 0.05)
}
\arguments{
\item{n}{Integer sample size, where \code{3} ≤ \code{n} ≤ \code{20}.}

\item{p}{Target two-sided exclusion probability. Only \code{0.05} is currently
implemented.}
}
\value{
Numeric scalar giving the cutoff in unscaled MAD units.
}
\description{
Returns the number of unscaled median absolute deviations from the median
required to exclude a proportion \code{p} of observations under normality, used in
the modified Z-score method for non-parametric outlier detection¹. Values
were obtained via Monte Carlo root-finding using 10 million replicates per
iteration and rounded to two decimal places.
